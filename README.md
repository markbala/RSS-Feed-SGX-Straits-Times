# RSS-Feed-SGX-Straits-Times
Personal RSS Feed for SGX Company announcements and Straits Times News.

Checks for updates every 60secs.

Cycles through the 10 latest updates (20 in total) from SGX and ST.

Runs "always on top" (i.e. floating above all open applications).

if you don't have the feedparser library installed, run:
```pip install feedparser```

Use Python 3

Most free RSS readers refresh every 30 - 60mins, which is a little too infrequent for my work, thus the need for this short script.
